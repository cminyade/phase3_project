# Overview
This project analyzes the data set attached in the `data` folder. It invloves business understanding, data preparation and scaling, modeling and visualization to provide valuable insights for a business stakeholder to prevent customer churn and retain their clients.

# Business and Data Understanding
SyriaTel, a telecommunications company is facing a common issue in the telecom industry i.e; customer churn, when customers stop using the companies services. Churn directly affects revenue, increases cutomer acquisition costs and can damage brand loyalty initiatives.
The `goal` of this project is to help SyriaTel `predict` which customers are likely to churn using the historical data, to enable the company take measures to retain their customers.

# Data
The data [SyriaTel Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/becksddf/churn-in-telecoms-dataset) is from Kaggle, also provided in the Canva project description.
In my analysis, I worked with the following columns `international plan`, `voice mail plan` and dropped these `state`, and `phone number` as they are not likely useful for prediction.
